Submission for Evaluating an Open Source Project assignment

| **Criterion** | **Evaluation Data** | **Score** |
|--|--|--|
| Project Name & URL | HTTPS Everywhere<br/>https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere | 2 |
| Licensing | Uses the GPL v2+ license, according to their LICENSE.txt | 2 |
| Language | The languages used are Python 48.6%, JavaScript 39.6%, Shell 9.1%, HTML 2.1%, CSS 0.6%. The only thing I don’t recognize is “Shell,” so I think I could contribute or learn how to contribute to most of the project | 2 |
| Activity | Number of commits have been generally decreasing for the past year, but there’s activity each quarter | 2 |
| Issue tracker | The most recent update on an open project occurred 14 days ago | 1 |
| Number of contributors | 660 Contributors | 2 |
| New contributor | “Getting started” instructions in the README, they talk about mailing lists and have style guides in the CONTRIBUTING.md file | 2 |
| Community norms | I couldn't find anything about community norms. Maybe something exists, but it isn't easily identifiable/accessible | 1 |
| Size | The size is 259.33 MB. I’m not sure what that means in terms of number of lines, but the Coconut Tutorial is only 1.15 MB and the Coconut Tutorial is very small | 2 |
| User base | The Chrome web store says that the app has 2,037,795 users. The app is also available on Firefox, Firefox for Android, and Opera, but I don’t have those numbers | 2 |
| Total | I think this is a project that I could contribute to after reading all of the introductory documents and learning about what issues need working on | 15 |
